  <header class="atitle">Moonshine and Moon Speck are on tap for the eclipse</header>
  <section class="section1">
    <p>COLUMBIA — A local brewery and a distillery are offering alternative ways to experience the eclipse.

    <p>Logboat Brewing Co. is releasing Moon Speck ale to memorialize the event, and Rocheport Distilling Co. is offering a new moonshine.</p>

    <p>Moon Speck is named in honor of Angela Speck, a professor and the director of astronomy in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at MU, an expert on the upcoming eclipse. Although Speck doesn’t drink, she gave a presentation on the eclipse at Logboat in May.</p>

    <p>Logboat describes the black ale as a very dark ale that actually drinks like a hoppy pale ale. The local brewery wanted to make a black ale to match the darkness of the solar phenomenon in Missouri.</p>

    <p>Andrew Sharp, co-founder of Logboat, said they have been thinking about the commemorative beer for over a year. They didn’t decide on the name until they met Speck and asked her opinion. She approved it, Sharp said, because although it's a solar eclipse, "the moon blacks it out."</p>

    <p>In addition to the dark color, Moon Speck has another special feature to fit the celestial event. "We want to touch a piece of the outer space," Sharp said. They obtained a piece of a Fukang meteorite, a pallasite first discovered in China, and dipped it into the beer fermenters.</p>

    <p>The commemorative beer is on the market from Aug. 16 until the end of the month, sold in cans at restaurants, bars and groceries and in draft at the taprooms in Columbia and St. Louis. Logboat will also sell raffle tickets for a 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse, the proceeds to be given to CASA (Columbia Aeronautics and Space Association) and the Department of Astronomy at MU.</p>

    <p>Moon Speck is not the only choice for people who want to try an eclipse-themed local drink.</p>

    <p>Rocheport Distilling Co will release a moonshine on Saturday to celebrate the eclipse at their distillery.</p>

    <p>Distiller Gary S. Paxton III said that they have been planning for the new moonshine for about six months. The clear distillate, made from a blend of corn, wheat, barley and sugar, features a smooth and rounded taste, he said.</p>

    <p>There will be around 500 bottles in all and will be served at the Saturday party for the coming eclipse, along with cocktails and music.</p>

  <header class="atitle">Whitegate residents receptive to possible neighborhood park
  </header>
  <section class="section1">
    <p>The possibility of getting a park in the Whitegate neighborhood is a sound idea to Ryan Welch.</p>
    <p>“If we had a park, we’d be there all the time,” Welch said.</p>

    <p>The Columbia Parks and Recreation Department is requesting City Council approval to acquire vacant land at the corner of Towne and Whitegate drives, according to a staff memo to the council. The land would be used to develop a park with amenities such as a playground, walking trail, basketball court and shelter.</p>

    <p>The memo says the city's 2013 Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan identified the neighborhood as having a need for the park. </p>

    <p>Welch has lived in the Whitegate neighborhood for about three years with his daughter, Rylie, 8, and his son, Kyle, 7, and their 4-year-old dog, Mazy. Rylie and Kyle usually play with their friends at home.</p>

    <p>A lot of families live in the area, and Welch said he thinks kids would be able to hang out more if there was a park.</p>

    <p>“They could become more active,” Welch said.</p>

    <p>Although Chris Newman has only lived in the neighborhood for a few months, he has noticed children playing in the streets and playing basketball outside.</p>

    <p>Welch said many people who live in the neighborhood don’t have cars. Although people here can ride the city bus, it would be more convenient to have a park within walking distance.</p>

    <p>“There is a bunch of kids around here, and they got nothing to do,” Welch said. “I think it will keep a lot of kids out of trouble.”</p>

    <p>Ronald Mixon, who has lived in the area for about seven years, agreed the neighborhood needs a park to keep the children safe from playing in the street.</p>

    <p>Carmen Niles, a longtime resident of the neighborhood, said people drive through the neighborhood like Indy 500 racers, and a park would at least keep children off the street.</p>

    <p>However, not everyone agrees a neighborhood park is a good idea. Marilyn Broussard has lived in Whitegate for six years. She worries that people might use the park to sell drugs.</p>

    <p>Quail Drive, a few blocks from the vacant land, is one of the most consistently violent areas in Columbia, troubled by gunshots and drug problems, according to previous Missourian reporting.</p>

    <p>“It will be a good thing, though,” Welch said. “They need it, the kids need it, for sure, because it is a rough neighborhood back there.”</p>

    <p>The 2.24 acres of land would cost the city $250,000 and would be funded through the parks sales tax. It would not be developed until after the 2021 renewal of the sales tax.</p>

    <p>Columbia Insurance Group, which owns the property, approached the city about selling it, according to the council memo. The property is actually worth about $490,000, according to a September appraisal. The difference between that value and the city's purchase price will be treated as a donation.</p>

    <p>The council is expected to vote on the land acquisition at its meeting Tuesday.</p>
